<p>Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh<br />
  Is it that sweet? I guess so<br />
  Say you can't sleep, baby, I know<br />

  Switch it up like Nintendo<br />

  That morning coffee, brewed it for ya (yes)<br />
  One touch and I brand-newed it for ya</p>

  My twisted humor make him laugh so often<br />
